title: Starting with Android security 01 (My own 101)
---

The first blog post. Actually I don't know what to write, so I'll just a small blogpost/briefing/remembering or whatever about security for Android applications. I'll start with the basics, but trying to dig up as much as I can. The goal is not to find a 0-day in the SO, but to do an approximation with regular applications.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
